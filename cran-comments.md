## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Inserted suppressWarnings(RNGversion("3.5.0")) before calling set.seed() in the test scripts
* Updated license template

## Test environments
* Windows 10, R 3.3.3 (local)
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
